# Algorithms
This repository contains many algorithms I implemented myself as a part of a learning process.


Algorithms:

1. Sorting algorithms:
  - heap sort
  - insertion sort
  - quick sort
  - selection sort
  
2. Min Spanning Tree with the use of:
  - Kruskal method
  - Prim Method

3. Longest Common Subsequence

4. Hash Table With Open Addressing with the use of:
  - double hashing
  - linear probing
  - quadratic probing
  
5. Hash Table with chaining. Included time measurements (comparison between time of seaarching for different hash sizes).

6. Deterministic finite search automaton text search.
